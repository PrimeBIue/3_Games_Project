# 3_Games_Project
The repository containing the codes for my "3 Games" Arduino project. Where I used an Adafruit to display a selection menu, display a pong games and used leds to make a Simon Says game.
The project should really be called 2 Games since I couldn't implement the last game because of memory issues.

*THIS PROJECT USES THE VERSION 1.1.2 OF THE ADAFRUIT SSD1306 LIBRARY, OTHER VERSIONS WILL EITHER NOT WORK OR CONSIDERABLY SLOW DOWN THE DISPLAY.*
